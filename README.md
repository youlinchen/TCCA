## Simulation
Figures 1 and 2 in the TCCA paper are generated by `Figure_1.ipynb` and `Figure_2.ipynb`, respectively.

## Gene Expression Data
go https://github.com/pachterlab/PCCA/ and run their code first.
The result is generated by geno_expression_gTCCA.ipynb and geno_expression_gTCCA_deflation.ipynb

## Air Pollution Data in Taiwan
Original data can be download from https://taqm.epa.gov.tw/taqm/en/YearlyDataDownload.aspx.
The result are generated by `twn_air_pollution.ipynb`.

Note that you will need to install the package `folium` for visualization.  
If you are using `conda` for managing packages, you can run  

    conda install -c conda-forge folium

to install the package.

## Electricity Demands in Adelaide
